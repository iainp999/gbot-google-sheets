# GlitcherBot Google Sheets Subscriber

Listens for glitcherbot crawling events, gathers data, and will write data to Google sheets at the end of the crawl.

## Configuration

You will need to create a new application via the Google developer's console and create some OAUTH2 credentials with 
permissions to write to Google sheets.  The type should be 'Desktop App'.

Once done, download your credentials.json file and place it in the GoogleSheets folder.
